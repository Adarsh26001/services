        <p>Bezond Hied Private Limited is a newly established private company that was incorporated just last year, on January 27, 2020. As a non-governmental organization, it is registered with the Registrar of Companies in Kanpur, India, indicating it is operating within the country's legal and regulatory framework. The company's modest authorized share capital of 100,000 Indian rupees, with the same amount paid up, suggests it is still in the early stages of its operations, likely working to build up its resources and capabilities. Bezond Hied Private Limited's primary business activity involves the manufacture of various chemical products, positioning it as a supplier or manufacturer for other industries that require specialized chemicals for their own products and processes. This specialized focus within the chemical manufacturing sector could allow the company to carve out a unique niche and establish itself as an expert provider of certain in-demand formulas and compounds.</p>
        <p>Despite its young age of just over a year, Bezond Hied Private Limited has already held at least one Annual General Meeting, demonstrating that it is actively managing its corporate governance and maintaining proper reporting and compliance standards. The company's most recent balance sheet, filed with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs on March 31, 2021, provides valuable insight into its financial standing and performance over its inaugural year of operations. This financial data will be crucial for the company as it seeks to secure financing, win new contracts, and make strategic decisions about its future growth and development. Guiding Bezond Hied Private Limited through this early stage are two directors, Abhishek Tiwari and Akanksha Tiwari, who are likely the founders or other key decision-makers responsible for the company's strategic direction.</p>
        <p>Bezond Hied Private Limited can be easily identified and tracked through its unique Corporate Identification Number, U24290UP2020PTC126217, as well as its registration number of 126217. The company's### `services.html` (continued)
